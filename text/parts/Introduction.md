*A Storm Eternal* is a game of a world on the edge of change.
You’ll create characters who will have a place in the forging
of the age to come—shaping it or being shaped by it—and
play to find out what fates await them.

## Rolling the Dice

When a player character does something uncertain and
important, its time to roll the dice.

The player takes two six-sided dice, rolls them, and adds them together. The GM decides what stat applies, if any, and the player adds the stat the GM named to the total.

The GM describes what happens based on the total. A total of 10+ is a success: it turns out as well as could be hoped for, given the situation. A 7–9 is a partial success: the player gets some of what they set out to do, but with a compromise, choice, or cost decided by the GM. A 6- is a failure, something goes wrong.

+++

## Rulings

During play, some situations will come up often enough that you will develop a standard way of handling them. Any time a given way of handling a roll becomes a standard part of your toolkit, write it down on the rulings sheet.

For example, in your game the giving of speeches may become a common occurrence (since the riverfolk have a tradition of host speeches at meals). Since making a proper speech that honors all involved is uncertain and important, the first time it happens the player making the speech rolls the dice. As more speeches happen during play the GM begins to handle them all the same way. Since making speeches is now always handled the same way the GM can write it down as a ruling.

### Starting Rulings

There are some situations we’ve already found to come up commonly in play. These are printed on the rulings sheet to start with, but like any other ruling they are yours to modify, add, or remove. Note that some of the player character abilities interact with the starting rulings, so you may have to make other changes if you change a starting ruling.

+++

#### Resort To The Sword

---
Resort to the Sword.md
---

This ruling covers most physical combat, either on a personal level or for a group. It need not literally be swords, it covers all sorts of weapons.

Dealing enough harm to kill your enemy and spending enough to come out on top and have them at your mercy are both ways of winning a fight, though they carry different implications. Killing all your enemies is a good way to make more enemies, while a captive's ransom can be a powerful benefit.

+++

#### Invoke The Forms

---
Invoke The Forms.md
---

A form is anything a person of a given culture, religion, or generation would react to. The choices on the player sheet describe some of the major cultures, religions, and generations, but more may come up during play.

The Riverfolk, for example, tend to value caution and fairness. When negotiating the release of captives with a riverfolk warmaster, playing to their fairness may allow you to invoke the forms.

Traditions are a particularly good way to invoke the forms.
Claiming your right to trial by combat among the mountain clans can put your captor in a position where they must accept your request.

Even a 10+ only binds them to act as their culture, religion or generation would have them. Invoking a ritual of the Ancients to try to turn a circle of Ancient-worshippers into an orderly fighting force does not stand a chance, as the Faith of the Ancients is not orderly by its nature. You may be able to bring order to them, but not by appealing to their religion.

+++

#### Enflame Their Passions

---
Enflame Their Passions.md
---

A passion is anything that might drive a persion to action, and are not limited to those listed. What passion is foremost in an NPC is the GMs decision, and may not be obvious to a player character unless they find a way to discover it, perhaps by drawing the NPC out.

Typically this roll only applies to one NPC at a time, though the Herald of the Ancients can prey on the passions of crowds.

+++

#### Hold True

---
Hold True.md
---

Just as NPCs passions may be enflamed, a player character's passions may lead them to action they wouldn't otherwise take.
This roll is usually called for by the GM, though a player can say call for a roll for themselves. A player character's passions are for the player to decide, though they should be reflected in play. If your character has cut a bloody swath through every one who crosses them, don't be surprised if the GM expects you to have to hold true against your passion for revenge.

Think of this roll as your character's brain chemistry, those behaviors that you fall into if you like it or not.

+++

#### Argue Your Case

---
Argue Your Case.md
---

Iron-clad logic and reasoning are the strategy here, leaving them no out. Unlike preying on their ingrained behaviors (invoking the forms) or their drives (enflaming their passions), arguing your case is about making a cogent and irrefutable argument for your point.

If on a 7-9 they choose to take interference when acting on their plans, the form of the interference is left to the GM.
For an NPC it might be resistance from someone close to them who took your argument to heart, or a mistake from the lingering doubts that you gave them. For a player character it could be holding true in the face of their own doubt, or treating the result of a roll to carry out their plan as one step lower (a 6- instead of a 7-9, for example.

+++

#### Supplicate Your Gods

---
Supplicate Your Gods.md
---

The gods have their own agendas, and react to mortal supplication as befits their grand plans. The different gods will grant supplicants boons befitting their nature.

The gods favor those who further the gods' goals. How the player answers the gods’ questions may influence what their supplication brings.

+++

#### Draw Them Out

---
Draw Them Out.md
---

Drawing a person out is how you gain information about them. People are normally guarded when they know someone is trying to get information from them, so putting them at ease or under stress is part of this move, as is observing them carefully.

The answers you get are always in the form of what your character observes and what they can imply from it:
"you can tell from the tightness in his shoulders that he's expecting a fight any moment, and is ready for it."

+++

#### Survey The Field

---
Survey the Field.md
---

Surveying the field gets information from your surroundings (as opposed to a person). The answers you get are always in the form of what your character observes and what they can imply from it: "the way the bandits are arranged shows they the one in the back with the spear is calling the shots here, even though he looks the most unkempt of all of them."

+++

## Fates & Harm

A character’s health is tracked by their fates. Each character (or group of characters, for some NPCs) has a list of Fates. Each fate can be unmarked, temporarily marked, or
permanently marked.

The highest unmarked fate predominates and describes what the character’s future holds at this very moment. Think of it as what a seer would find in their future, if they looked into it from now.

The last two fates get worse on their own, unless some form of healing is applied. The other fates do not get worse or better on their own.

When a character takes harm, they subtract their armor, then mark off a number of fates starting from the top equal to the harm taken. If all fates are marked the character is dead or dying. These marks are temporary until the season changes, when they may become permanent.

Direct healing, such as medical care of wicker-wise magic, can only restore certain fates, and can only remove temporary marks.

### Seasons

When the season turns (spring to summer, summer to fall, fall
to winter, winter to spring), if a character spent significant
time in that season in rest and recuperation they unmark two
temporarily marked fates. Then any fates that remain marked
become permanently marked and cannot be restored.

+++

## Character Change

When a player wants to modify their character (perhaps
gaining a new move, increasing an ability score, or becoming part of a new culture or religion) the player tells the GM
what they’d like to improve. The GM will tell the player how
many checks it will take, and what action their character
can take to gain checks.

For example, the Herald of the Ancients wants to increase
their Rites by dedicating herself to the sea god with the help
of the wicker-wise. The GM tells her this will take 5 checks
and that checks can be gained any time she encounters the
magic of the sea god in a new way.

+++

## Equipment, Arms, & Bounty

Each player is entitled to starting equipment befitting their station. The slayer has specific supernatural choices, for every other playbook it depends on the established character. Some potential starting equipment:

* A dirk, shortbow, shortsword, or spear (2 harm)
* A mace, longsword, halbred, or longbow (3 harm)
* A mail shirt or leather jerkin (1 armor)
* A round shield (1 armor)
* A helm (1 armor)
* A mountain pony or warhorse
* A small sailboat
* A hut, house, or manor

### Bounty
Trade goods are measured in bounty, defined as “a very valuable amount.” A bounty of food may be enough to march a small army on, while a bounty of arms might be enough for only small warband, and a bounty of gems could be just a few. A bounty is an easy way of saying “you have a significant amount of this” and doing basic trade. If the exact number or amount within a bounty of something matters, the specifics are up to the GM.

### The Slayer’s Armory
The slayer has access to many weapons and items which may do something. This means that under some circumstances they will behave as described, but it’s up to the slayer to discover how to reliably use this magic.

+++

## This Is All True
The rulings laid out here are all true. The Ancients and unknowably powerful. Permanently marked harm can’t be healed. A new age will come. These are all facts.

Until they’re not. At some point a player will want to break the rules. They’ll want to face an ancient as equals, or heal permanent harm, or something stranger. This is all possible, but we don’t know how.

How is up to you. When a player wants to do something that doesn’t seem possible, tell them yes, but (choose one or more):

* The best they can do is a lesser version
* It’ll cost them _______ to do it
* They’ll have to gain knowledge of how from _________
* First you must _________
* You’ll need help from __________
* You’ll risk danger from ____________
