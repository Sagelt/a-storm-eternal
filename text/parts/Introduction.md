*A Storm Eternal* is a game of a world on the edge of change.
You’ll create characters who will have a place in the forging
of the age to come—shaping it or being shaped by it—and
play to find out what fates await them.

## Playing _A Storm Eternal_

_A Storm Eternal_ is played with a Game Master (GM) and 2-5 players.

The GM is responsible for:

* Establishing **truths** which are widely known facts about the world, the cultures within it, and the living things that inhabit it.
* Creating **secrets** which are facts not known to the players about the world, cultures, and living things.
* Recording **questions** that evolve in play which are unknown and not-yet-established elements of the world, cultures, and living things.
* Presenting important situations derived from the truths, secrets, and questions to the players and following their actions in response.
* Arbitrating the rules.

The players are responsible for:

* Creating their **characters** as active participants in the forming of a new world in a time of change.
* Suggesting **truths** related to their characters’ place in the world.
* Actively driving their characters forward to pursue their own goals and reacting to situations as they develop.
* Applying the rules.

## Moves

Some actions the player characters take are resolved by **moves.** Each move says when it applies and what happens when it applies. **Core moves** apply to actions taken by any player character, while **playbook moves** apply only to those that have gained that move.

If no move applies the GM describes the outcome based on the circumstances. In most cases this is entirely straightforward: when a player character scrambles over a stone wall into ancient ruins no move applies, so the GM tells them what they see on the other side. When a player character talks to an NPC if no move triggers the GM responds as the NPC would.

### Dice And Stats

Some moves say to “roll” or “roll+” something.

**Roll** means rolling two six sided dice and adding them together. Each move will say how to read the total, but generally a 10+ is the best possible outcome, a 6- is the worst, and 7-9 are a compromise in between.

**Roll+ _something_** means you add something to the roll—the move will say what. Most often this is one of the character’s stats:

* _Cunning:_ their wits and wiles
* _Grace:_ their empathy and connection to others
* _Prowess:_ their physical power and reflexes 
* _Rites:_ their ability to effect the supernatural
* _War:_ their tactics, strategy, and leadership

### Playbook Moves

Each character playbook has its own moves which are described in that playbook. They function the same as core moves, but are available only to the characters that have taken them.

Some moves, such as The Outlaw Heir’s _Much Yet To Learn,_ grant moves from another playbook. 

### Core Moves

The core moves (listed over the next several pages) describe the  activities that most matter to the types of scenarios _A Storm Eternal_ aims for. They are available to all player characters and apply whenever they are triggered—the player cannot choose to not make a move if it triggers, nor can they trigger a move without their character doing a suitable action.

#### Resort To The Sword

---
Resort to the Sword.md
---

This ruling covers most physical combat, either on a personal level or for a group. It need not literally be swords, it covers all sorts of weapons.

Dealing enough harm to kill your enemy and spending enough to come out on top and have them at your mercy are both ways of winning a fight, though they carry different implications. Killing all your enemies is a good way to make more enemies, while a captive's ransom can be a powerful benefit.

+++

#### Invoke The Forms

---
Invoke The Forms.md
---

A form is anything a person of a given culture, religion, or generation would react to. The choices on the player sheet describe some of the major cultures, religions, and generations, but more may come up during play.

The Riverfolk, for example, tend to value caution and fairness. When negotiating the release of captives with a riverfolk warmaster, playing to their fairness may allow you to invoke the forms.

Traditions are a particularly good way to invoke the forms.
Claiming your right to trial by combat among the mountain clans can put your captor in a position where they must accept your request.

Even a 10+ only binds them to act as their culture, religion or generation would have them. Invoking a ritual of the Ancients to try to turn a circle of Ancient-worshippers into an orderly fighting force does not stand a chance, as the Faith of the Ancients is not orderly by its nature. You may be able to bring order to them, but not by appealing to their religion.

+++

#### Enflame Their Passions

---
Enflame Their Passions.md
---

A passion is anything that might drive a persion to action, and are not limited to those listed. What passion is foremost in an NPC is the GMs decision, and may not be obvious to a player character unless they find a way to discover it, perhaps by drawing the NPC out.

Typically this roll only applies to one NPC at a time, though the Herald of the Ancients can prey on the passions of crowds.

+++

#### Hold True

---
Hold True.md
---

Just as NPCs passions may be enflamed, a player character's passions may lead them to action they wouldn't otherwise take.
This roll is usually called for by the GM, though a player can say call for a roll for themselves. A player character's passions are for the player to decide, though they should be reflected in play. If your character has cut a bloody swath through every one who crosses them, don't be surprised if the GM expects you to have to hold true against your passion for revenge.

Think of this roll as your character's brain chemistry, those behaviors that you fall into if you like it or not.

+++

#### Argue Your Case

---
Argue Your Case.md
---

Iron-clad logic and reasoning are the strategy here, leaving them no out. Unlike preying on their ingrained behaviors (invoking the forms) or their drives (enflaming their passions), arguing your case is about making a cogent and irrefutable argument for your point.

If on a 7-9 they choose to take interference when acting on their plans, the form of the interference is left to the GM.
For an NPC it might be resistance from someone close to them who took your argument to heart, or a mistake from the lingering doubts that you gave them. For a player character it could be holding true in the face of their own doubt, or treating the result of a roll to carry out their plan as one step lower (a 6- instead of a 7-9, for example.

+++

#### Supplicate Your Gods

---
Supplicate Your Gods.md
---

The gods have their own agendas, and react to mortal supplication as befits their grand plans. The different gods will grant supplicants boons befitting their nature.

The gods favor those who further the gods' goals. How the player answers the gods’ questions may influence what their supplication brings.

+++

#### Draw Them Out

---
Draw Them Out.md
---

Drawing a person out is how you gain information about them. People are normally guarded when they know someone is trying to get information from them, so putting them at ease or under stress is part of this move, as is observing them carefully.

The answers you get are always in the form of what your character observes and what they can imply from it:
"you can tell from the tightness in his shoulders that he's expecting a fight any moment, and is ready for it."

+++

#### Survey The Field

---
Survey the Field.md
---

Surveying the field gets information from your surroundings (as opposed to a person). The answers you get are always in the form of what your character observes and what they can imply from it: "the way the bandits are arranged shows they the one in the back with the spear is calling the shots here, even though he looks the most unkempt of all of them."

+++

## Fates & Harm

A character’s health is tracked by their fates. Each character (or group of characters, for some NPCs) has a list of Fates. Each fate can be unmarked, temporarily marked, or
permanently marked.

The highest unmarked fate predominates and describes what the character’s future holds at this very moment. Think of it as what a seer would find in their future, if they looked into it from now.

The last two fates get worse on their own, unless some form of healing is applied. The other fates do not get worse or better on their own.

When a character takes harm, they subtract their armor, then mark off a number of fates starting from the top equal to the harm taken. If all fates are marked the character is dead or dying. These marks are temporary until the season changes, when they may become permanent.

Direct healing, such as medical care of wicker-wise magic, can only restore certain fates, and can only remove temporary marks.

### Seasons

When the season turns (spring to summer, summer to fall, fall
to winter, winter to spring), if a character spent significant
time in that season in rest and recuperation they unmark two
temporarily marked fates. Then any fates that remain marked
become permanently marked and cannot be restored.

+++

## Regard

A character’s regards are their strongest connections to others. Regards are phrased as “I _relation_ _person_ the most”: “I trust Valdor the most”, “I understand Harlow the most”, and so on.

Each player character starts with a single regard for another player character. More regards may be gained through character change (see below).

When a regard applies to a roll add +1 to the result. A regard applies when it would influence the character with the regard making the roll.

Regards are introspective and may not be known by the subject of the regard. If Fáron trusts Valdor the most, it doesn’t matter if Valdor knows that, or if Valdor is actually trustworthy. It only matters that Fáron trusts Valdor the most, and that that impacts his actions.

+++

## Oaths

Oaths are public statements of binding intent. Oaths:

* Are sworn _on something_
* Are sworn _to someone_
* Are sworn _to an achievable purpose_

When an oath is sworn, the swearing character notes it on their character sheet. When pursuing that oath the character gets +1 on rolls related to the oath.

Each character can have only one oath at a time.

### Swearing An Oath

When you swear an oath make a formal declaration including:

* Who you are swearing to
* What you are swearing on
* What you swear to do

If they accept your oath write it in your character sheet.

### Pursuing An Oath

When you take an action that is directly and obviously in service of your oath take +1 on any rolls. The player of the character the oath was sworn to (the GM for NPCs) decides if it is unclear.

### Fulfilling An Oath

When you believe your oath is fulfilled present yourself to the person the oath is sworn to and ask them if your oath is fulfilled. If they agree erase your oath and they choose one:

* You increase a stat by 1 (max 3)
* You gain a new move
* You gain a new regard (in addition to existing regards)
* You receive a boon from your gods (GM describes)

### Releasing An Oath

When you give up an oath present yourself to the person the oath is sworn to (or your gods if you cannot face them), erase your oath, and admit your failure. They will tell you how you can atone and the burden you will carry until you atone:

* Reduce a stat (their choice) by 1
* Lose access to a specific move
* A supernatural mark

You cannot swear another oath until you atone.

+++

## Equipment, Arms, & Bounty

Each player is entitled to starting equipment befitting their station. The slayer has specific supernatural choices, for every other playbook it depends on the established character. Some potential starting equipment:

* A dirk, shortbow, shortsword, or spear (2 harm)
* A mace, longsword, halbred, or longbow (3 harm)
* A mail shirt or leather jerkin (1 armor)
* A round shield (1 armor)
* A helm (1 armor)
* A mountain pony or warhorse
* A small sailboat
* A hut, house, or manor

### Bounty
Trade goods are measured in bounty, defined as “a very valuable amount.” A bounty of food may be enough to march a small army on, while a bounty of arms might be enough for only small warband, and a bounty of gems could be just a few. A bounty is an easy way of saying “you have a significant amount of this” and doing basic trade. If the exact number or amount within a bounty of something matters, the specifics are up to the GM.

### The Slayer’s Armory
The slayer has access to many weapons and items which may do something. This means that under some circumstances they will behave as described, but it’s up to the slayer to discover how to reliably use this magic.

+++

## Character Change

When a player wants to modify their character (perhaps
gaining a new move, increasing an ability score, or becoming part of a new culture or religion) the player tells the GM
what they’d like to improve. The GM will tell the player how
many checks it will take, and what action their character
can take to gain checks.

For example, the Herald of the Ancients wants to increase
their Rites by dedicating herself to the sea god with the help
of the wicker-wise. The GM tells her this will take 5 checks
and that checks can be gained any time she encounters the
magic of the sea god in a new way.

+++

## This Is All True
The rulings laid out here are all true. The Ancients and unknowably powerful. Permanently marked harm can’t be healed. A new age will come. These are all facts.

Until they’re not. At some point a player will want to break the rules. They’ll want to face an ancient as equals, or heal permanent harm, or something stranger. This is all possible, but we don’t know how.

How is up to you. When a player wants to do something that doesn’t seem possible, tell them yes, but (choose one or more):

* The best they can do is a lesser version
* It’ll cost them _______ to do it
* They’ll have to gain knowledge of how from _________
* First you must _________
* You’ll need help from __________
* You’ll risk danger from ____________

### Planning Sessions

Before sitting down to play a session use these steps to plan. A session plan is not a script to be followed, but starting momentum to begin play. You don’t need to know (and can’t know) how the session will end, only how it will begin.

Your session plan consists of:

* A recap of the previous session
* A set of questions you are interested in answering
* Notes on any follow up needed from last session
* An opening situation to begin play with
