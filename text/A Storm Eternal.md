# A Storm Eternal

*The Ancients are stirring.* Their sleep in the depths and
heights is ending, as is the age. The future is ungiven.
Power eternal emanates from the Ancients into their
heralds who will pave the way or bar it.

*The Corrupted spread.* The world is not meant for such
power and it writhes and twists, spawning abominations.
They are caught up in the power of the Ancients but do not
always serve it.

*A storm eternal rises again.* It will forge the new age. What
will your future bring?
