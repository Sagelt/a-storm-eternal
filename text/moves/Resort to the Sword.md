When you resort to the sword to enforce your will, roll your Prowess (or War, if you lead others to do the same). On 10+, spend 3 on the following. On 7-9, spend 2. On a miss, spend 1. If your opponent is a fellow player's character, they roll too and spend accordingly. If an NPC, the GM spends in secret based on the skill of the NPC (1-4, generally). Spend blind, without knowing how your opponent is spending theirs.

* For each 1 you spend to strike hard, inflict +1 Harm.
* For each 1 you spend to defend yourself, suffer -1 Harm.
* For each 1 you spend to come out on top, you better your chance to win.

Both of you reveal how you've spent. Exchange harm simultaneously, and then whoever spent more to come out on top has the other at their mercy. If this is a tie, both get 3 more to spend, blind as always, and so on until someone wins or someone is killed.
