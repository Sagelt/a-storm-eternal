When you supplicate your gods, roll your Rites. Answer the GM's questions:

* To what gods do you pray?
* What sacrifice or devotion do you offer, or what ritual do you perform?
* What do you hope will happen, and what do you fear might happen?
* How might your gods bless you in this?
* And any other question the GM chooses to have your gods ask you.

On 10+, something significant happens. It happens in the world, not in your mind. It is pointed, symbolic, inexplicable, or it strains coincidence. Ask the GM what it is. On 7-9, something significant happens to you alone: you see a vision, hear a voice, fall into a dream, or the like. It is pointed or symbolic. Ask the GM what it is.
