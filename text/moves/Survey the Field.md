When you to survey the field and take stock of your situation, roll your Cunning (or War, on the field of battle). On 10+, ask the GM 3 of the following questions. On 7-9, ask 2. On a miss, ask 1, in addition to whatever the GM says.

* Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?
* Who's in control here?
* How might I best ___________?
* What here is not what it seems?
* What here is most dangerous to me?
