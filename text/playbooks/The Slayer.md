## Moves
_Choose one to start with_

### Between Heartbeats
When you encounter something unnatural, roll your Cunning. On 10+, ask the MC 2 of these questions. On 7–9, ask 1.

- Is this a thing of old ways, of new ways, or of ways unknown to me?
- What kind of person made this thing, or is it its own?
- For what does this thing hunger, or on what is it sated?
- What does this thing make of us and our doings?
-  What would it make the world into, if it could?

On a miss, ask 1, but the thing asks a question of you in return, either from this list or a question of its own.

### Commanding Presence
When you give someone an order or a warning, roll your Prowess. On 10+, they choose 1:

- They follow your order or heed your warning.
- They freeze.
- They back away slowly.
- They attack you.
- 
On 7–9, they choose one of the above, or else:

- They scoff, but have their misgivings.
- They demand proof, an assurance, or an explanation.

On a miss, they dismiss you and continue in their course, with if anything more eagerness.

### Fame
When you argue your case, if they should resort to insult or passion, they thereby insult their own companions, friends, neighbors, or family, who know your name and hold it in high regard.

### A Use For Every Part
When you slay a beast, ask the GM what useful thing you can gather or make from the corpse.

## Armory
Your armory consists of 4 of your choice, in addition to those already marked. Anything you don't already have you know how to get. When the need arises, the MC will choose one:

- You have heard of someone who claims to have it. Ask the MC who.
- You've seen it hanging over someone's great table or in their trove. Ask the MC who.
- You've seen it in a shrine, grove, temple, or church. Ask the MC where.

Your armory:
- An antique breastplate bearing figures of the ancient heroes. 1 Armor. Might protect you from curses and death-words.
- An antler-spiked spear. 4 Harm. Might inflict wounds that never heal.
- An axe of church-bell bronze. 4 Harm. Might cleave the flesh of magical creatures, if they are enemies to the God of Civilization.
- A boar-spear of holy ash. 4 Harm. Might pierce the flesh of creatures otherwise immaterial. Its cross-bars might pin in this world creatures who could otherwise flee into another.
- A bronze helmet depicting the face of a lion or other fanciful beast. 1 Armor. Might allow you to see others' fears.
- A bronze sword, a thousand years old, which has always spilt the blood of the lawless. 4 Harm. Might wound any creature who is enemy to the Upstanding, even when other weapons cannot.
