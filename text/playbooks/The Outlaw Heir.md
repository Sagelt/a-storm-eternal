## Moves
_Choose one to start with_

### Beautiful & Doomed
When you make an entrance, grand or subtle, roll your Prowess. On 10+, choose someone present, they reveal (intentionally or unintentionally) their true feelings and disposition towards you. On a 7–9, as a 10+, but the GM chooses whom.

### Fated
When your fate is reduced to still drawing breath, judge yourself. If you have not yet done your duty to your family, reset your fate to having more to do before you die.

### Much Yet to Learn
When you take this move, choose your most trusted teacher or advisor. You immediately gain a move from their playbook (if they’re an NPC, ask the GM what playbook most closely fits). When you choose moves in the future you can choose moves from their playbook. If your trust shifts to another, you choose from their playbook going forward instead.

### By My Name
You may petition your ancestors as you would supplicate your gods, rolling with an extra +1.

### Allegiances Owed
When you make formal introductions to those who hail from your ancestral hearth ask them one question from the Draw Them Out list for free. When you make formal introductions to those from outside your ancestral hearth, roll your Cunning. On hit the GM will tell you what they owe your bloodline. On a 10+ you may also ask them one question from the Draw Them Out list. On a 6- you gain nothing on them.

## Ancestral Hearth
Your family once held a great hall and surrounding lands. The hall was

- A high-curtained castle.
- A powerful fortress keep.
- A stone and timber long-hall.

The hall sits

- In gloomy fens.
- In lonely, craggy hills.
- In the midst of rich farmlands.
- On bluffs overlooking the sea.
- Overlooking the busy Highway.

Now it is

- Empty and ruined
- The home of my enemies, as though it belonged to them

The lands the hall controls contains 5 of the following. A number of them equal to your Grace have hidden loyalty to your banner still, the others are completely under the sway of the usurpers.

- Mountains, hills, and all the wild clans that live there. Bounty: warriors. Want: invaders.
- Rich farmland, dotted with manors. Bounty: food. Want: famine.
- A vast forest and all the hamlets and game therein. Bounty: game. Want: outlaws.

- Sacred sites where the pilgrims come. Bounty: peace. Want: heresy.
- _________, a sage advisor. Bounty: wisdom. Want:
intrigue.
- _________, a champion. Bounty: morale. Want:
desertion.
